        <h3><p>Welcome to my page :3</p></h3>
        <h4><p>
            Might write more here later but for now enjoy my gifs on the main page ^-^. <br>
            I hope to make this a cool little place to write some stuff about myself or stuff that interests me. <br>
            I tried to make this in a style that emulates mid/late 2000s personal webpages. I found some good gifs for the main page on GifCities.org. <br>
            This was also made intentionally for the webring that my amazing friend Emilia was setting up. <br> 
            Hopefully you (the viewer of my fantastic webpage) enjoy this... <br> <br>
            Time to write some stuff about myself it seems. <br>
            My name is June, I am a CompSci student in my second year of University. <br>
            I did my fist year at the University of Oklahoma however I am now at Colorado Mesa University. <br>        
            Due to my transfer I have to retake some basics but I am quickly catching up since I have basically no GenED classes to take <br>
            I'm currently in CS1 which is a basic C++ class, but next year I will take CS2 and 3 concurrently alongside a database class. <br>
            Generally I would consider myself ahead of my other classmates since I have been coding since I was a child, but I am still quite a beginner coder. <br>
            I try my best but a lot of my code ends up being quite bad and basic. Still though I am happy with a lot of the work I do.<br>
