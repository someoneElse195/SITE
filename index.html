                <h3><p>Welcome to my homepage :3</p></h3>
                <h4><p>
                    Might write more here later but for now enjoy my gifs ^-^. <br>
                    I hope to make this a cool little place to write some stuff about myself or stuff that interests me. <br>
                    I tried to make this in a style that emulates mid/late 2000s personal webpages. I found some good gifs for the upper part of this page on GifCities.org. <br>
                    This was also made intentionally for the webring that my amazing friend Emilia was setting up. <br> 
                    Hopefully you (the viewer of my fantastic webpage) enjoy this... <br> <br>
                    Time to write some stuff about myself it seems. <br>
                    My name is June, I am a CompSci student in my second year of University. <br>
                    I did my fist year at the University of Oklahoma however I am now at Colorado Mesa University. <br>        
                    Due to my transfer I have to retake some basics but I am quickly catching up since I have basically no GenED classes to take <br>
                    I'm currently in CS1 which is a basic C++ class, but next year I will take CS2 and 3 concurrently alongside a database class. <br>
                    Generally I would consider myself ahead of my other classmates since I have been coding since I was a child, but I am still quite a beginner coder. <br>
                    I try my best but a lot of my code ends up being quite bad and basic. Still though I am happy with a lot of the work I do.<br>
